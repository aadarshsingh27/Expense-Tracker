# 💰 SpendSmart - Intelligent Expense Tracker

**SpendSmart** is a modern, full-stack expense tracking application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It goes beyond simple logging by integrating **AI-powered insights** to give you real-time feedback on your spending habits, along with professional reporting tools.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 AI Financial Advisor
-   **Smart Analysis**: Automatically analyzes your spending patterns to provide personalized financial advice (e.g., "High Food Spending").
-   **Intelligent Fallback**: Works perfectly even without an API key! The system uses advanced heuristics to calculate detailed insights from your actual data if the AI service is unavailable.
-   **Interactive Dashboard**: View insights directly on your dashboard with "Warning", "Tip", and "Praise" categories.

### 📊 Comprehensive Expense Management
-   **Modern Floating UI**: A beautiful, card-based interface for adding expenses with intuitive icons and floating labels.
-   **Dynamic Currency Support**: Seamlessly switch between **INR (₹), USD ($), EUR (€), and GBP (£)** instantly across the entire app.
-   **Visual List**: Clean, readable list of all your expenses with color-coded category tags (Health, Food, Entertainment, etc.).

### 📄 Professional Reporting
-   **PDF Export**: Generate professional-grade PDF reports of your expenses with a single click.
-   **Auto-Formatted Tables**: Your data is meant to be shared. The PDF includes perfectly aligned tables with currency symbols handled correctly (e.g., using "Rs." for compatibility).

### 🛡️ Secure & User-Friendly
-   **Full Authentication**: Secure Login and Registration system using JWT and Bcrypt.
-   **Profile Control**: Users have full control, including a **Delete Profile** feature to permanently remove their account and data.
-   **Responsive Design**: A fully responsive "Hero" landing page and dashboard that looks great on desktop and mobile.
